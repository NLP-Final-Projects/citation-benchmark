        "### Planning and Intelligence\n",
        "The operation was the culmination of years of intelligence work. In September 2010, the CIA identified a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, believed to be housing bin Laden. This was based on surveillance photos and intelligence reports indicating that a known al-Qaeda courier was visiting the compound. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence that bin Laden was present, the intelligence was deemed strong enough to justify an operation[5].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Execution of the Raid\n",
        "The mission was executed by the Red Squadron of U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six, chosen for their extensive experience and specialized skills. The SEALs were transported by two helicopters piloted by Army aviators from a U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, to the compound in Pakistan. The mission commenced on May 1, 2011, at 10:30 p.m. local time[2].\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon arrival, one helicopter experienced instability and made a hard landing inside the compound, but the SEALs continued the mission without injury. The team engaged in a firefight as they moved through the compound. They encountered resistance and killed several combatants, including bin Laden's couriers and his son, Khalid[2][5].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Killing of Osama bin Laden\n",
        "Osama bin Laden was found on the third floor of the main building. He was killed in his bedroom, where he was found with at least one weapon nearby. The SEALs collected documents and electronics for intelligence purposes before destroying the downed helicopter to protect its stealth technology[2].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Aftermath and Confirmation\n",
        "The SEALs spent about 45 minutes on the ground before departing with bin Laden's body. In Afghanistan, his identity was confirmed through DNA analysis, fingerprinting, and facial recognition. The body was then flown to the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea, where bin Laden was buried at sea following Islamic funeral rites to prevent his gravesite from becoming a shrine[2][5].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Significance\n",
        "The operation marked a defining moment in U.S. military history, ending the life of the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. It was a testament to the intelligence and military collaboration that enabled the successful execution of such a high-stakes mission[5].\n",

            " Kris Osborn & Ho Lin Updated April 06, 2022 | Published April 30, 2018 “The American team engaged in a firefight. Osama bin Laden did resist.” These words, uttered by a senior Pentagon official, summed up the now-historic raid on May 2, 2011, during which SEAL Team Six secretly descended upon a compound in Pakistan, blew down doors and engaged enemy combatants. The goal: kill or capture terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Gunfire was exchanged as SEALs made their way through the compound, up to the second and third floors, where bin Laden and his family were hiding. Four combatants and one woman used as a human shield were killed in the raid, according to Pentagon statements. “The sole focus of the operation was to kill or capture Osama bin Laden,” a Defense Department official told reporters after the raid, during a background briefing. As we recognize the anniversary of the raid, it would likely be an understatement to call it a “defining moment” in U.S. military history. With its successful completion, the operation ended the life of the man regarded as the mastermind behind the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which claimed thousands of lives. Tracking Down Bin Laden For years, military and intelligence forces had scoured the globe to find bin Laden’s hideout, and in September 2010, the CIA got the lead it needed when it used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine that a known al-Qaida courier was visiting a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Over the next few months, the CIA used informants, surveillance and other intelligence gathering measures to arrive at the conclusion that bin Laden and his family were hiding out in the compound – but up until the attack, there was no hard proof that bin Laden was present, only the best guess available. President Barack Obama discussed the decision to attack with \"60 Minutes\" after the raid. “This was a very difficult decision, in part because the evidence we had was not absolutely conclusive,” he said. Obama said he and his team were not surprised to find bin Laden hiding in plain sight, but were surprised to learn that the compound had been there for so long without information leaking out about it. “I think the image that bin Laden had tried to promote was that he was an ascetic, living in a cave,” Obama told \"60 Minutes.\" “This guy was living in a million-dollar compound in a residential neighborhood.” “It was the best intelligence work I’ve ever seen that enabled those in the military who executed this mission to do so successfully,” former Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen told a DoD reporter. “There was only a 55% chance that the 9/11 attack mastermind was in the compound.” Neptune Spear The actual raid on bin Laden’s compound was called Operation Neptune Spear, after the trident that appears on the U.S. Navy's Special Warfare insignia. On the night of the infiltration, two dozen SEALs flew in using two helicopters, beneath the radar and varying routes to avoid detection. News reports described bin Laden’s compound as surrounded with barbed wire and 18-foot walls. There were also seven-foot walls surrounding the balconies. Additionally, the compound was designed to obscure lines of sight from multiple directions. As the raid commenced, the tail of one of the helicopters grazed the compound wall, forcing it into a “soft crash” landing that fortunately did not result in major injuries, although the helicopter itself had to be destroyed so none of its tech would fall into the wrong hands. Using night-vision goggles (power on the street had been cut off), the SEALs infiltrated the compound, killing anyone who put up resistance, securing the women and children, clearing weapons stashes and barricades, and taking anything that could contain secret information, including hard drives and cell phones. The SEALs quickly made their way up to the third floor, where they found the terrorist leader in his bedroom and killed him. Accounts of how this happened differ, depending on the source. SEAL Robert O’Neill has claimed to be the “ SEAL who shot bin Laden ”. SEAL Matt Bissonnette , who entered the room at the same time and wrote about the operation in the book \"No Easy Day,\" also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body. In any case, there was no doubt about the outcome of the mission when the SEAL team leader radioed in, \"For God and country -- Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo,\" thus declaring the raid a success. At the conclusion of the raid, the SEALs evacuated the area with bin Laden’s body, with an extra Chinook helicopter flown in to provide transportation. From beginning to end, the operation had taken less than 40 minutes. Using known photos and facial recognition software, as well as measuring the corpse, CIA specialists determined with 95% certainty that the body was that of Osama bin Laden. Other specialists in the intelligence community performed initial DNA analysis, which resulted in a virtual 100% DNA match of the body against DNA of several bin Laden family members. Bin Laden was buried at sea. “For us to be able to definitively say, ‘We got the man who caused thousands of deaths here in the United States and who had been the rallying point for a violent extremist jihad around the world’ was something that I think all of us were profoundly grateful to be a part of,” Obama said at the time.

U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six is part of the Joint Special Operations Command, which is part of the U.S. Special Operations Command and conducts classified high-priority missions. The Red Squadron within U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six was chosen for the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound because it had just returned to the United States from a deployment in Afghanistan. Since they were scheduled for normal leave, the Red Squadron operators were able to train for the mission without attracting unwanted attention. The individual SEALs were selected for their extensive experience in demanding operations and specialized skills. SEAL is an acronym for Sea, Air, and Land, referring to members’ ability to operate in all conditions. Vest worn by combat dog Cairo during raid on Osama bin Laden’s residence. Courtesy of Will Chesney. Two helicopters piloted by Army aviators transported 23 SEALs, an interpreter, and a combat dog to carry out the raid. The mission was dubbed Operation Neptune Spear, a nod to the U.S. Navy SEAL insignia. On May 1, 2011, at 10:30 p.m. local time, the team took off from a U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Two additional helicopters followed into Pakistan with extra fuel and a backup force. Arriving at the compound, one helicopter became unstable, forcing a hard landing inside the compound. The team of SEALs onboard was safe, and the mission continued. Bolt cutters used by a U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six member during Operation Neptune Spear. Courtesy of Anonymous. Inside the compound’s walls, several SEALs approached the guesthouse where one of Osama bin Laden’s couriers lived. The SEALs found the door locked and were preparing to blow it open when they were fired upon through the door. The SEALs returned fire. Soon, the door opened, and a woman came out carrying a child, followed by other children. Beyond her, lying dead, was her husband, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, bin Laden’s primary courier. Bullet shrapnel from the firefight lodged in the handle of a pair of bolt cutters one of the SEALs carried in his backpack. When I personally got around to the front side of the main house, one of my guys said, “I shot one of the guys, his wife jumped in the middle of it, and I shot her.” And it kind of occurred to me, well, they’re trying to martyr themselves, to save their husbands. Something big is here. —Anonymous, U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six In the main building, SEALs killed the second courier and his wife on the first floor and bin Laden’s son, Khalid, who was armed, on the second-floor landing. They killed Osama bin Laden in his third-floor bedroom, where he was found with at least one weapon nearby.

Watch recovered from Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad Courtesy of the FBI Experience, FBI Headquarters, Washington, D.C. With Osama bin Laden dead, the SEALs collected documents, electronics, and other materials for intelligence exploitation. As a backup helicopter arrived, they blew up the downed helicopter to destroy its stealth technology. Locals gathered outside the compound, and Pakistani authorities began to mobilize a response to the late-night disturbance. After about 45 minutes on the ground, the SEALs boarded the helicopters, taking with them the collected materials and bin Laden’s body. In Afghanistan, law enforcement and intelligence officers analyzed bin Laden’s DNA and took his fingerprints. Facial recognition analysis, together with the biometric information, ultimately confirmed his identity. American forces then flew bin Laden’s body to the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea. After religious funeral rites, Osama bin Laden was buried at sea so his gravesite would not become a shrine for his followers.

The mission was dubbed Operation Neptune Spear, a nod to the U.S. Navy SEAL insignia. On May 1, 2011, at 10:30 p.m. local time, the team took off from a U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Two additional helicopters followed into Pakistan with extra fuel and a backup force. Arriving at the compound, one helicopter became unstable, forcing a hard landing inside the compound. The team of SEALs onboard was safe, and the mission continued. Bolt cutters used by a U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six member during Operation Neptune Spear. Courtesy of Anonymous. Inside the compound’s walls, several SEALs approached the guesthouse where one of Osama bin Laden’s couriers lived. The SEALs found the door locked and were preparing to blow it open when they were fired upon through the door. The SEALs returned fire. Soon, the door opened, and a woman came out carrying a child, followed by other children. Beyond her, lying dead, was her husband, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, bin Laden’s primary courier. Bullet shrapnel from the firefight lodged in the handle of a pair of bolt cutters one of the SEALs carried in his backpack.

            " Kris Osborn & Ho Lin Updated April 06, 2022 | Published April 30, 2018 “The American team engaged in a firefight. Osama bin Laden did resist.” These words, uttered by a senior Pentagon official, summed up the now-historic raid on May 2, 2011, during which SEAL Team Six secretly descended upon a compound in Pakistan, blew down doors and engaged enemy combatants. The goal: kill or capture terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Gunfire was exchanged as SEALs made their way through the compound, up to the second and third floors, where bin Laden and his family were hiding. Four combatants and one woman used as a human shield were killed in the raid, according to Pentagon statements. “The sole focus of the operation was to kill or capture Osama bin Laden,” a Defense Department official told reporters after the raid, during a background briefing. As we recognize the anniversary of the raid, it would likely be an understatement to call it a “defining moment” in U.S. military history. With its successful completion, the operation ended the life of the man regarded as the mastermind behind the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which claimed thousands of lives. Tracking Down Bin Laden For years, military and intelligence forces had scoured the globe to find bin Laden’s hideout, and in September 2010, the CIA got the lead it needed when it used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine that a known al-Qaida courier was visiting a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Over the next few months, the CIA used informants, surveillance and other intelligence gathering measures to arrive at the conclusion that bin Laden and his family were hiding out in the compound – but up until the attack, there was no hard proof that bin Laden was present, only the best guess available. President Barack Obama discussed the decision to attack with \"60 Minutes\" after the raid. “This was a very difficult decision, in part because the evidence we had was not absolutely conclusive,” he said. Obama said he and his team were not surprised to find bin Laden hiding in plain sight, but were surprised to learn that the compound had been there for so long without information leaking out about it. “I think the image that bin Laden had tried to promote was that he was an ascetic, living in a cave,” Obama told \"60 Minutes.\" “This guy was living in a million-dollar compound in a residential neighborhood.” “It was the best intelligence work I’ve ever seen that enabled those in the military who executed this mission to do so successfully,” former Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen told a DoD reporter. “There was only a 55% chance that the 9/11 attack mastermind was in the compound.” Neptune Spear The actual raid on bin Laden’s compound was called Operation Neptune Spear, after the trident that appears on the U.S. Navy's Special Warfare insignia. On the night of the infiltration, two dozen SEALs flew in using two helicopters, beneath the radar and varying routes to avoid detection. News reports described bin Laden’s compound as surrounded with barbed wire and 18-foot walls. There were also seven-foot walls surrounding the balconies. Additionally, the compound was designed to obscure lines of sight from multiple directions. As the raid commenced, the tail of one of the helicopters grazed the compound wall, forcing it into a “soft crash” landing that fortunately did not result in major injuries, although the helicopter itself had to be destroyed so none of its tech would fall into the wrong hands. Using night-vision goggles (power on the street had been cut off), the SEALs infiltrated the compound, killing anyone who put up resistance, securing the women and children, clearing weapons stashes and barricades, and taking anything that could contain secret information, including hard drives and cell phones. The SEALs quickly made their way up to the third floor, where they found the terrorist leader in his bedroom and killed him. Accounts of how this happened differ, depending on the source. SEAL Robert O’Neill has claimed to be the “ SEAL who shot bin Laden ”. SEAL Matt Bissonnette , who entered the room at the same time and wrote about the operation in the book \"No Easy Day,\" also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body. In any case, there was no doubt about the outcome of the mission when the SEAL team leader radioed in, \"For God and country -- Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo,\" thus declaring the raid a success. At the conclusion of the raid, the SEALs evacuated the area with bin Laden’s body, with an extra Chinook helicopter flown in to provide transportation. From beginning to end, the operation had taken less than 40 minutes. Using known photos and facial recognition software, as well as measuring the corpse, CIA specialists determined with 95% certainty that the body was that of Osama bin Laden. Other specialists in the intelligence community performed initial DNA analysis, which resulted in a virtual 100% DNA match of the body against DNA of several bin Laden family members. Bin Laden was buried at sea. “For us to be able to definitively say, ‘We got the man who caused thousands of deaths here in the United States and who had been the rallying point for a violent extremist jihad around the world’ was something that I think all of us were profoundly grateful to be a part of,” Obama said at the time.

U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six is part of the Joint Special Operations Command, which is part of the U.S. Special Operations Command and conducts classified high-priority missions. The Red Squadron within U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six was chosen for the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound because it had just returned to the United States from a deployment in Afghanistan. Since they were scheduled for normal leave, the Red Squadron operators were able to train for the mission without attracting unwanted attention. The individual SEALs were selected for their extensive experience in demanding operations and specialized skills. SEAL is an acronym for Sea, Air, and Land, referring to members’ ability to operate in all conditions.

Two helicopters piloted by Army aviators transported 23 SEALs, an interpreter, and a combat dog to carry out the raid. The mission was dubbed Operation Neptune Spear, a nod to the U.S. Navy SEAL insignia. On May 1, 2011, at 10:30 p.m. local time, the team took off from a U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Two additional helicopters followed into Pakistan with extra fuel and a backup force. Arriving at the compound, one helicopter became unstable, forcing a hard landing inside the compound. The team of SEALs onboard was safe, and the mission continued. Bolt cutters used by a U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six member during Operation Neptune Spear. Courtesy of Anonymous. Inside the compound’s walls, several SEALs approached the guesthouse where one of Osama bin Laden’s couriers lived. The SEALs found the door locked and were preparing to blow it open when they were fired upon through the door. The SEALs returned fire. Soon, the door opened, and a woman came out carrying a child, followed by other children. Beyond her, lying dead, was her husband, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, bin Laden’s primary courier. Bullet shrapnel from the firefight lodged in the handle of a pair of bolt cutters one of the SEALs carried in his backpack. When I personally got around to the front side of the main house, one of my guys said, “I shot one of the guys, his wife jumped in the middle of it, and I shot her.” And it kind of occurred to me, well, they’re trying to martyr themselves, to save their husbands. Something big is here. —Anonymous, U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six In the main building, SEALs killed the second courier and his wife on the first floor and bin Laden’s son, Khalid, who was armed, on the second-floor landing. They killed Osama bin Laden in his third-floor bedroom, where he was found with at least one weapon nearby.

With Osama bin Laden dead, the SEALs collected documents, electronics, and other materials for intelligence exploitation. As a backup helicopter arrived, they blew up the downed helicopter to destroy its stealth technology. Locals gathered outside the compound, and Pakistani authorities began to mobilize a response to the late-night disturbance. After about 45 minutes on the ground, the SEALs boarded the helicopters, taking with them the collected materials and bin Laden’s body. In Afghanistan, law enforcement and intelligence officers analyzed bin Laden’s DNA and took his fingerprints. Facial recognition analysis, together with the biometric information, ultimately confirmed his identity. American forces then flew bin Laden’s body to the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea. After religious funeral rites, Osama bin Laden was buried at sea so his gravesite would not become a shrine for his followers.

            " Kris Osborn & Ho Lin Updated April 06, 2022 | Published April 30, 2018 “The American team engaged in a firefight. Osama bin Laden did resist.” These words, uttered by a senior Pentagon official, summed up the now-historic raid on May 2, 2011, during which SEAL Team Six secretly descended upon a compound in Pakistan, blew down doors and engaged enemy combatants. The goal: kill or capture terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Gunfire was exchanged as SEALs made their way through the compound, up to the second and third floors, where bin Laden and his family were hiding. Four combatants and one woman used as a human shield were killed in the raid, according to Pentagon statements. “The sole focus of the operation was to kill or capture Osama bin Laden,” a Defense Department official told reporters after the raid, during a background briefing. As we recognize the anniversary of the raid, it would likely be an understatement to call it a “defining moment” in U.S. military history. With its successful completion, the operation ended the life of the man regarded as the mastermind behind the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which claimed thousands of lives. Tracking Down Bin Laden For years, military and intelligence forces had scoured the globe to find bin Laden’s hideout, and in September 2010, the CIA got the lead it needed when it used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine that a known al-Qaida courier was visiting a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Over the next few months, the CIA used informants, surveillance and other intelligence gathering measures to arrive at the conclusion that bin Laden and his family were hiding out in the compound – but up until the attack, there was no hard proof that bin Laden was present, only the best guess available. President Barack Obama discussed the decision to attack with \"60 Minutes\" after the raid. “This was a very difficult decision, in part because the evidence we had was not absolutely conclusive,” he said. Obama said he and his team were not surprised to find bin Laden hiding in plain sight, but were surprised to learn that the compound had been there for so long without information leaking out about it. “I think the image that bin Laden had tried to promote was that he was an ascetic, living in a cave,” Obama told \"60 Minutes.\" “This guy was living in a million-dollar compound in a residential neighborhood.” “It was the best intelligence work I’ve ever seen that enabled those in the military who executed this mission to do so successfully,” former Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen told a DoD reporter. “There was only a 55% chance that the 9/11 attack mastermind was in the compound.” Neptune Spear The actual raid on bin Laden’s compound was called Operation Neptune Spear, after the trident that appears on the U.S. Navy's Special Warfare insignia. On the night of the infiltration, two dozen SEALs flew in using two helicopters, beneath the radar and varying routes to avoid detection. News reports described bin Laden’s compound as surrounded with barbed wire and 18-foot walls. There were also seven-foot walls surrounding the balconies. Additionally, the compound was designed to obscure lines of sight from multiple directions. As the raid commenced, the tail of one of the helicopters grazed the compound wall, forcing it into a “soft crash” landing that fortunately did not result in major injuries, although the helicopter itself had to be destroyed so none of its tech would fall into the wrong hands. Using night-vision goggles (power on the street had been cut off), the SEALs infiltrated the compound, killing anyone who put up resistance, securing the women and children, clearing weapons stashes and barricades, and taking anything that could contain secret information, including hard drives and cell phones. The SEALs quickly made their way up to the third floor, where they found the terrorist leader in his bedroom and killed him. Accounts of how this happened differ, depending on the source. SEAL Robert O’Neill has claimed to be the “ SEAL who shot bin Laden ”. SEAL Matt Bissonnette , who entered the room at the same time and wrote about the operation in the book \"No Easy Day,\" also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body. In any case, there was no doubt about the outcome of the mission when the SEAL team leader radioed in, \"For God and country -- Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo,\" thus declaring the raid a success. At the conclusion of the raid, the SEALs evacuated the area with bin Laden’s body, with an extra Chinook helicopter flown in to provide transportation. From beginning to end, the operation had taken less than 40 minutes. Using known photos and facial recognition software, as well as measuring the corpse, CIA specialists determined with 95% certainty that the body was that of Osama bin Laden. Other specialists in the intelligence community performed initial DNA analysis, which resulted in a virtual 100% DNA match of the body against DNA of several bin Laden family members. Bin Laden was buried at sea. “For us to be able to definitively say, ‘We got the man who caused thousands of deaths here in the United States and who had been the rallying point for a violent extremist jihad around the world’ was something that I think all of us were profoundly grateful to be a part of,” Obama said at the time.
